# Gene Rank

Studying the expression level of genes in tissue, organs, or cells is often used in oncology to investigate the genetic causes of cancer. However, each individual possesses over 20,000 genes in their body, so it is necessary to implement a method to highlight a list of priority genes to study within a set of genes. Such a technique would then allow for a quicker understanding of the biological processes of each living organism and expedite biological studies.

We will thus attempt to address the following problem:
Given a set S of genes, is it possible to effectively highlight a list of priority genes for study?

## Problematic 

To address this problem, we will propose an algorithm for "gene scoring." To do this, we will provide a representation of the organism's genes in the form of a graph. We will then use this structure to implement such an algorithm.
